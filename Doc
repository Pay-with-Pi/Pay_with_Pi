# Pay with Pi App

Pay with Pi App is an example of how you can implement the various required flows in your app's code.
It aims to show you how to use Pay with Pi Platform API on the backend side and Pay with Pi SDK on the frontend side of your app.


It is composed of two major parts:

* **backend**: a backend app (a very simple JSON API built using Node and ExpressJS)
* **frontend**: a single-page frontend app (built using React and create-react-app)
